## DESCRIPTION 
 - This is a Python-Flask Application that allows users to create one minute pitch. You only have 60 seconds to impress someone. 1 minute can make or break you.
The users will submit their one minute pitches and other users will vote on them and leave comments to give their feedback on them.
